# Terms
- **DNS**: Domain Name System
	- translates human friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresses
	![[Pasted image 20230817155912.png]]
	- **Domain Registrar**: Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, etc.
	- **DNS Records**:
		- ***A***: maps hostname to IPv4
		- ***AAAA***: maps hostname to IPv6
		- ***CNAME***: maps hostname to another hostname
			- target domain name must have A or AAAA record
			- can't create record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Ape)
		- ***NS – Name Servers for the Hosted Zone***: control how traffic is routed for a domain
		- ***Zone File***: contains DNS records
		- ***Name Server***: resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative)
		- ***Top Level Domain (TLD)***: .com, .us, .in, .gov, .org, …
		- ***Second Level Domain (SLD)***: amazon.com, google.com
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation
	- lightweight format for storing and transporting data
	- data in name/value pairs
- **SDK**: Software Development Kit
	- set of tools for third-party developers to use in the producing applications using a particular framework
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
	- software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud
	- on-demand configurable pool of shared resources allocated within a public cloud environment
- **IPv4**: most common, ex. 1.160.10.240
- **IPv6**: newer, used for IoT, ex. 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf
- **Public IP**
	- the machine can be identified on the internet
	- must be unique
	- can be geo-located easily
- **Private IP**
	- can only be identified on a private network
	- must be unique withing the private network
- **Elastic IP**
	- public IPv4 you own as long as you don't delete it
	- can only attach to one instance at a time
	- useful for masking the failure of an instance or software by remapping the address to another instance
	- max 5
	- **avoid this**
- **IOPS**: input/output operations per second
	- unit of measurement for storage system performance based on drive speed and workload type
- **NFS**: network file system
	- allows users to access files over a computer network
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol
	- standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
	- email, texting, file transfer, web browsing
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol
	- used to send messages to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.
	- live streaming, online gaming, video chat
- **SSL**: Secure Sockets Layer
	- encrypt connections
- **TLS**: Transport Layer Security
	- newer version of SSL, but people still refer to it as SSL
- **SSH**: Secure Shell Protocol
	- cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
	- its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution 
	- SSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.
- **Unicast IP**: one server holds one IP
- **Anycast IP**: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the closest one
